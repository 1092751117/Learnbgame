- Branch smoothing.

INSTALL

1.  Get Blender for your appropriate OS at www.blender.org and install it.

2.  Launch Blender and open up the User Preferences from the File menu. Switch to the Addons tab and press the button Install from File. Browse to where you downloaded The Grove. Select TheGrove6Addon.zip and press Install from File... in the top right.

3.  Find the add-on in the list and enable it by checking the box to the left.

4.  Press Save User Settings to save your preferences and have The Grove installed next time you open Blender.

CHECK YOUR INSTALLATION

Close the User Preferences window. From the menu in the bottom of the 3D view, select Add > Mesh > The Grove. Not much will have happened until you open up the tool shelf from the View menu (or simply press t to toggle it).

The tool shelf will open to the left of the 3D view and most of it is occupied by the tool shelf tabs. At the bottom you will find the current tool options titled The Grove. If not, there's a small + icon at the very bottom. Click it and drag the divider up over the tool tabs to get some more space. Make the tool shelf a bit wider by dragging the border with the 3D view to the right.

When the Add-on shows up, your installation was successful. Be sure to back up your downloaded copy of The Grove Add-on for the future. After installing an update of Blender, it might be necessary to repeat the above steps.

Have fun growing!
